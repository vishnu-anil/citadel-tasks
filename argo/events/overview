Eventbus
The eventbus acts as the transport layer of Argo-Events by connecting the event-sources and sensors.

Event-Sources
publish the events while the sensors subscribe to the events to execute triggers.
Event source templates samples: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/examples/event-sources/aws-sns.yaml
Eg:
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventSource
metadata:
  name: aws-sns
spec:
  service:
    ports:
      - port: 12000
        targetPort: 12000
  sns:
    example:
      # arn of SNS topic
      topicArn: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:XXXXXXXX:test
      # hook contains configuration for the HTTP server running in the event-source.
      # AWS will send events to following port and endpoint
      webhook:
        # endpoint to listen events on
        endpoint: "/"
        # port to run HTTP server on
        port: "12000"
        # HTTP request method to allow. In this case, only POST requests are accepted
        method: POST
        # url of the event-source service to use to register at AWS.
        # This url must be reachable from outside the cluster.
        # The event-source pod is backed by the service defined in the event-source spec. So get the URL for that service AWS can reach to.
        # The name for the service is in `<event-source-name>-eventsource-svc` format.
        # You will need to create an Ingress or Openshift Route for the event-source service so that it can be reached from AWS.
        url: http://url-that-is-reachable-from-AWS
      # accessKey contains information about K8s secret that stores the access key
      accessKey:
        # Key within the K8s secret whose corresponding value (must be base64 encoded) is access key
        key: accesskey
        # Name of the K8s secret that contains the access key
        name: aws-secret
      # secretKey contains information about K8s secret that stores the secret key
      secretKey:
        # Key within the K8s secret whose corresponding value (must be base64 encoded) is secret key
        key: secretkey
        # Name of the K8s secret that contains the secret key
        name: aws-secret
      # aws region
      region: us-east-1



Sensor
Sensor defines a set of event dependencies (inputs) and triggers (outputs). It listens to events on the eventbus and acts as an event dependency manager to resolve and execute the triggers.
Complete sensor specification is available: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/api/sensor.md
Sample sensor templates: https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/tree/master/examples/sensors

eg: 
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sensor
metadata:
  name: webhook
spec:
  dependencies:
    - name: test-dep
      eventSourceName: webhook
      eventName: example
  triggers:
    - template:
        name: lambda-trigger
        awsLambda:
          functionName: hello
          region: us-east-1
          payload:
            - src:
                dependencyName: test-dep
                dataKey: body.name
              dest: name

          # Optional, possible values: RequestResponse, Event and DryRun
          # Defaults to RequestResponse, which means invoke the function synchronously.
          invocationType: Event

          # Optional, use if ServiceAccount doesn't have IAM Role assigned.
          # More information on IAM roles for service accounts:
          # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html
          accessKey:
            name: aws-secret
            key: accesskey
          secretKey:
            name: aws-secret
            key: secretkey

          # Optional, use if your IAM user/role should assume another role to
          # perform this action
          roleARN: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/some-role

Event dependency
A dependency is an event the sensor is waiting to happen.
