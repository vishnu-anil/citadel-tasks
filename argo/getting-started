Went through the workflows.
What is a workflow?
A workflow is defined as a Kubernetes resource. Each workflow consists of one or more templates, one of which is defined as the entrypoint. 
Each template can be one of several types, in this example we have one template that is a container.


kubectl -n argo wait deploy --all --for condition=Available --timeout 2m

* created new workflow with below template

============
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  name: hello  
spec:
  entrypoint: main # the first template to run in the workflows        
  templates:
  - name: main           
    container: # this is a container template
      image: docker/whalesay # this image prints "hello world" to the console
