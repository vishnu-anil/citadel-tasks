Webhooks
We've use the api/v1/workflows endpoint to create workflows, but there's one endpoint who is specifically designed to support creation of workflows via an api: api/v1/events. You should prefer this for most cases (including Jenkins)

It only allows you to create workflows from workflow templates, so is more secure.
It allows you to parse the HTTP payload and use it as parameters.
It allows you to integrate with other systems without you having to change those systems.
Webhooks also have support Github and Gitlab, so you can trigger workflow from a code commit.
To use this, you need to create a workflow template and a workflow event binding.:


A workflow event binding consists of:

An event selector that matches events.
A reference to a workflow template.
Optional parameters.
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowEventBinding
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  event:
    selector: payload.message != ""
  submit:
    workflowTemplateRef:
      name: hello
    arguments:
      parameters:
        - name: message
          valueFrom:
            event: payload.message

In the above example, if the event contained a message, then we'll submit the workflow template and the workflow will echo the message.

Create the workflow template:

kubectl apply -f hello-workflowtemplate.yaml

Create the workflow event binding:

kubectl apply -f hello-workfloweventbinding.yaml

Try it out:

curl http://localhost:2746/api/v1/events/argo/- -H "Authorization: $ARGO_TOKEN" -d '{"message": "hello events"}'
