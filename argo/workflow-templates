What other types of work template are there?

A container set allows you to run multiple containers in a single pod. This is useful when you want the containers to share a common workspace.

A data template allows you get data from storage (e.g. S3). This is useful when each item of data represents an item of work that needs doing.

A resource template allows you to create a Kubernetes resource and wait for it to meet a condition (e.g. successful) . This is useful if you want to interoperate with another Kubernetes system, Spark EMR.

A script template allows you to run a script in a container. This is very similar to a container template, but when you've added a script to it.



DAG Template
https://www.katacoda.com/argoproj/courses/argo-workflows/templates
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: dag-
spec:
  entrypoint: main
  templates:
    - name: main
      dag:
        tasks:
          - name: a
            template: whalesay
          - name: b
            template: whalesay
            dependencies:
              - a
    - name: whalesay
      container:
        image: docker/whalesay
        command: [ cowsay ]
        args: [ "hello world" ]

The DAG has two tasks: "a" and "b". Both run the "whalesay" template, but as "b" depends on "a", it won't start until " a" has completed successfully

LOOPS
The ability to run large parallel processing jobs is one of the key features or Argo Workflows. Lets have a look at using loops to do this.
A DAG allows you to loop over a number of items using withItems:

      dag:
        tasks:
          - name: print-message
            template: whalesay
            arguments:
              parameters:
                - name: message
                  value: "{{item}}"
            withItems:
              - "hello world"
              - "goodbye world"
