Workflow templates (not to be confused with a template) allow you to create a library of code that can be reused. They're similar to pipelines in Jenkins.

Workflow templates have a different kind to a workflow, but are otherwise very similar:

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: WorkflowTemplate
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  entrypoint: main
  templates:
    - name: main
      container:
        image: docker/whalesay
