* Understood what is a CRD and CR
* Installation of prometheus using prometheus operator with helm charts managed by prometheus community

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts

helm repo update

helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack

* You can run helm get manifest prometheus | kubectl get -f - command to see all the objects created 

* Difference between scrape config and servicemonitor

* kubectl port-forward  prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-0 9090:9090 

* Checked by proxy forwarding and accessing prometheus ui the configurations, targets added etc

* Podmonitor: 
  PodMonitor declaratively specifies how to directly monitor a group of pods.

PodMonitor vs ServiceMonitor
One must be wondering that when we have ServiceMonitor in place, then what is the need to have PodMonitor which ultimately do the same job as ServiceMonitor.

The way I see it, ServiceMonitor is suitable if you already have a Service for your pods. However, if in a certain scenario, you donâ€™t have it, then PodMonitor is the right choice.

Target discovery:

Static config: One has to manually populate each configs whihc is tidious

service discovery: There are different Prometheus supported service-discovery mechanisms like DNS, Kubernetes, AWS, Consul, custom one, etc. These mechanisms dynamically discover target endpoints to be monitored and scraped. In the case of Kubernetes, it uses the Kubernetes API to discover a list of target endpoints to monitor and scrape.
